This is a module to use sonar with play. It is an alpha version.
You need your own sonar server and the "Java Runner for sonar":http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Analyse+with+a+simple+Java+Runner .

h2. How it works

This module generates  the sonar config file for your application at your application root folder (_sonar-project.properties_).
In addition it precompiles the classes for findbugs. For findbugs are only the production classes accessible.

h2. Example

Download this entire folder.
In folder _exampleApp_ is a play app that uses this module. 

h2. Module installation

Add this modules to your _dependencies.yml_ and add the following keys to your _application.conf_:

<pre>sonar.projectKey = key-of-project
sonar.projectName = name of the project
sonar.projectVersion = 0.1</pre>

The Java Runner for sonar should be available in ${PATH}, so you can call it with _sonar-runner_.

h2. Run the analysis

Start your sonar server and enter in your command line:
<pre>play sonar && sonar-runner</pre>
